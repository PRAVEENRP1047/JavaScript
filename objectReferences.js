/** Value Types */

/**
 *  Value types in JavaScript are primitive data types.
 *  When a variable holds a primitive value, the variable directly contains the value itself
 *  Primitive types are immutable. Meaning, when we try to reassign an existing variable with value,
 * then a new value is created and the variable now points to the latest value while the original value 
 * remains the same.
