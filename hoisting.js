/**
 * Hoisting:
 *  During the memory creation phase of the execution context, JavaScript allocates memory for
 * variables and functions.
 *  var variables are hoisted and initialized with undefined.
 *  let and const variables are hoisted but remain uninitialized (they are placed in the Temporal
 * Dead Zone until their declaration is executed).
 *  Function declarations are hoisted with their actual function reference.
 *  This means you can access var variables before their declaration (getting undefined), but
 * accessing let or const variables before their declaration causes a ReferenceError.
 *  Overall, hoisting is the behavior that lets variable and function declarations appear to be
 * “moved to the top” of their scop
